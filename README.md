This repository contains the basic files of code in Java. Over a series of projects and several code reviews, there are
at least 1,000 functioning lines of code used that comprise several different parts of the backend of a search engine
via use of a web crawler. Additionally at least 500 lines of comments. 


Created by Matthew Chin. A project showing backend software development.




**September 2023 Updates**

The search engine will see massive updates to the backend and will be reworked as such. If possible, frontend will also be added wherever deemed most appropriate. 



Old files can be seen in the folder [2019-legacy-project](https://github.com/matthewjchin/web-search-crawler/tree/master/2019-legacy-product).
